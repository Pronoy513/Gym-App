## Dart and Flutter
Dart is a modern, client-optimized programming language optimized for building mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. It serves as the foundation for our project.

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets for creating modern, responsive user interfaces.
